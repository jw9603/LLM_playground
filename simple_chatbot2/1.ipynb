    "Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first summary should be long (8-10 sentences, ~200 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., \"this article discusses\") to reach ~200 words.\n",
    "- Make every word count: rewrite the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\n",
    "- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article discusses\".\n",
    "- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, i.e., easily understood without the article. \n",
    "- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.\n",
    "- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.\n",
    "Answer \"Missing Entities\" and \"Denser_Summary\" as in TEXT format.\n",
    "Use only KOREAN language to reply.\"\"\"\n",
